**What is functional programming?**

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions while promoting a code that doesnt change the data structure.



**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function**

- A pure function is where the code produces the same output  for the original input with no modifications.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

- when provided the same input, it will always return the same output with no side effects.


**What is immutability?**

- immutability is when a data's structure isnt changed after it's created
when an object has immutability, you have to create a new object to edit.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

- we need to import the module by using the require keyword at the top of the file so that the rendered result of is stored in a variable
