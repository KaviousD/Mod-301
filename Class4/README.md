# Introduction to React and Components

## Why It's Important

This information is important because it explains how to create forms in React and explains how it functions which allows us to add forms to our applications.

# What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**

+ a component that is controlled by state in React.JS


# Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

+ you should update the state when new info is added so users at all times can acess new info, so an immediate storage and update is needed


# How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

+ We use uncontrolled components since they update only the event handler they're attached

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

# Why would we use a ternary operator?

+ it lets us assign one value to the variable if its true and another value if its false, so its good for outputting two difference responses depending on the answer it recieves.


Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

+ x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
